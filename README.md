This is my first project using Java.

The goal of this project was to practice and solidify the concepts I learned during my first Java lesson. For the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML parts, I built upon my existing JavaScript knowledge with additional guidance and insights from ChatGPT.

This project serves as an essential foundation for my learning journey, helping me connect Java with front-end technologies and enhance my programming skills.
